            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS whiſper'd that <hi>Morphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> never walks in his ſleep, but when the Brains of <hi>Mercury</hi>'s winged Head drop into his leaden Heels. When you ſhall have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd theſe enſuing Papers, you will conclude, that although I have taken a long <hi>nap,</hi> I have had but little <hi>reſt:</hi> However, my Memory is not ſo defeated, but I may be able to make a diſcovery of ſuch Paſſages, as may be profitable for your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb facs="tcp:48978:3"/>
and pleaſant for your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
            <p>The Scenes indeed are laid in Viſionary-Lands, but the Actours of the enſuing Tragi-comedies were not <hi>Fairies,</hi> or <hi>Hobgoblins,</hi> but <hi>men of Renown, and famous in their generation;</hi> and though they be but <hi>Dreams,</hi> they lively repreſent the Subſtantial Miſeries which Ruffled the laſt Age, and Threaten this.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſubject matter</hi> you will find in the <hi>Title Page;</hi> more of it in the <hi>Contents;</hi> and moſt of all in the whole <hi>Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Style</hi> of my Writings ſhould make thee ſneeze like <hi>Guinea-</hi>Pepper, I hope 'twill clear thy head, and then thou wilt <hi>clear</hi> me. If any ſhall take ſnuff that I pick ſuch holes in the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>

of the Trent-Fathers, I have done no more than what <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> ſaid long ago of the 4th <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> Council: <hi>Concilium illud Generale, quod more Papali, Grandia prima fronte prae ſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, in riſum, &amp; ſcomma deſiit, quo Archiepiſcopos, Epiſcopos, Abbates, Decanos, Archidiaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, omneſque ad id Concilium accedentes Ludificatus eſt.</hi> If their own Writers thus boldly ſpeak the truth, why ſhould we be ſilent, who have been provok'd by ſuch inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and inſtructed by ſuch ſad and long experience?</p>
            <p>I have therefore endeavour'd to drag into the Light, from the very Land of Darkneſs, the whole Scheme and Myſtery of the <hi>Ridiculous</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties of an Hypocritical, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and Rebellious Age, and to
<pb facs="tcp:48978:4"/>
expoſe them to the juſt ſcorn and contempt of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding World. Why ſhould not the fooliſh wickedneſſes of men be ſcourg'd in a ſtrain that may make them moſt ſenſible of them? Who ever met with <hi>an Academy of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> for a <hi>Generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers?</hi> or a <hi>Help to Diſcourſe</hi> with a Drove of Aſſes? 'Tis true, that the Follies of Mankind do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther require our grief, than our mirth; but Tears will flow as well from exceſſive laughter, as ſorrow: Let men pretend what they will, our affections will be ſuitable to the Genuine Nature of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and therefore what mortal man could forbear <hi>Hummering</hi> to ſee Friar <hi>Juniperus,</hi> an old, moſſy, over-grown Coxcomb, playing at <hi>Titter-totter</hi> with the little

Boys, to <hi>teſtifie,</hi> forſooth, <hi>his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;</hi> or to reade of the <hi>Flemiſh Capuchin's</hi> inviting half a dozen Devils to come and lodge in his <hi>Corpuſculum,</hi> for fear of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, when he had driven them out of another man: this, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was a Caſt of <hi>his Charity.</hi> Have not theſe men Reform'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into ſuperfine Notions?</p>

               <hi>Knaves</hi> do Skulk and Leer when they ſee thoſe eyes that pierce through the varniſh of their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> into the villany of their <hi>deſigns?</hi> to ſee what ugly <hi>faces</hi> they make when a witty and juſt Satyr tickles their Guilty <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences?</hi> So true is the Saying of the Poet,</p>
            <p>—Ridiculum acri. Fortius &amp; melius magnas ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque ſecat res.</p>
            <p>But we have greater than <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Licence, even the Examples of the Holy <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> too: What ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere <hi>Ironies</hi> do we meet with in <hi>Irenaeus adverſus Haereſes,</hi> lib. 1. cap. 5? But in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we meet with many to ſhew,
<pb facs="tcp:48978:5"/>
that <hi>their folly ſhall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto all men,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 9. And <hi>that they might proceed no farther,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred up the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> to the fatal conſequences of their ſtrong deluſion, by <hi>Sarcaſms,</hi> that Bit as deep as their <hi>Knives</hi> wounded, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 27. But we do not deſire that the ſuperſtitious of our Age ſhould <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> but <hi>amend</hi> themſelves. Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his <hi>Hydriotaphia</hi> calls the 14 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a <hi>Poetical Taunt;</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens a <hi>Taunting Proverb,</hi> 2. 6. the <hi>Philippians</hi> are bid to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Dogs,</hi> cap. 3. v. 2. and the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>He that ſitteth in the Heavens ſhall have them in deriſion,</hi> Pſal. 2. 4. and <hi>the righteous ſhall laugh at him,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48978:6"/>
Pſal. 52. 6. Our Saviour himſelf <hi>whipt the buyers and ſellers</hi> out of the Temple, which they had made a <hi>den of Thieves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this way of writing is at preſent moſt <hi>neceſſary:</hi> We have the Reprobate Ghoſts of <hi>Celſus, Porphery</hi> and <hi>Lucian,</hi> ſtalking in the ſhapes of the prophane Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of this <hi>diſobedient</hi> Age. And therefore 'tis time that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit enchantments of ſuch <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians,</hi> who encourage a <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is <hi>as the ſin of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, and themſelves ſcourged with the ſame <hi>Rod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as theſe men offend in the <hi>ſubject Matter</hi> of their Writings, ſo ought we to take care that we offend not in the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>ours;</hi> we ought to keep within the bounds
<pb facs="tcp:48978:6"/>
of <hi>Religious Modeſty;</hi> for though the Scriptures are as <hi>ſharp as a two-edged Sword,</hi> and may <hi>wound</hi> to the <hi>healing,</hi> they do not <hi>venom</hi> to the <hi>deſtroying.</hi> I could never conceive that that is <hi>true wit,</hi> which is either <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi> or <hi>immodeſt,</hi> any more than that the <hi>Devil</hi> is in the true ſhape of a <hi>Man,</hi> when he has a <hi>Cloven foot;</hi> I thank God I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deteſted the one, as I have renounc'd the other: Beſides, as the <hi>Truth</hi> needs no <hi>lies,</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does <hi>Vertue</hi> any thing that is <hi>impure</hi> for its defence: the caſe of the <hi>immodeſt woman,</hi> Deut. 25. 11, 12. has a Moral ſignification; which is, that how great obligations ſoever we have to defend Goodneſs, yet we ought not to doe it by the diſcovery of
<pb facs="tcp:48978:7"/>
thoſe wicked actions; of which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is a ſhame to ſpeak;</hi> therefore I never valued the doctrine of Stage-Players: but I may ſay with <hi>Lactantius, Quid de mimis loquor Corruptela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum praeferentibus diſciplinam, qui docent adulteria dum fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt &amp; ſimulatis erudiunt ad vera?</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>IT was a brave Calm, and bright Moon-light night which invited me to take a ſolitary walk in the Ruines of the once flouriſhing and magnificent Monaſtery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Honour of St. <hi>Edmund,</hi>

the firſt King and Martyr (from whom the Town of St. <hi>Edmunds-Bury</hi> takes its name). I was uſed to be pleaſed with the gratefull horrour of that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Retirement, wherein I might Contemplate the various Fates of all the Glories under the Moon; and my Walk was advantag'd with the ragged ſhaddows which, to ſpeak in the Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick phraſe, fell from the tops of broken Turrets and decay'd Walls: How high Madam <hi>Cynthia</hi> had clambred towards the Zenith, to peep over them, is not my buſineſs to tell, nor had I much time to obſerve, for on a ſudden all the Sky was darkned, and a ſtrong Wind blew ſuch a Volly of Rain on my face, that it forc'd me to take ſhelter under the remains of a roof, which half co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a decay'd Chapel: I ſate down upon the Pedeſtal of a Pillar, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my head againſt it, there was ſuch a dreadfull noiſe all about me, as if not the Monaſtery only, but the whole World alſo were diſſolving; all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties were preſently huſh'd, and my thoughts jumbled into a confuſion of fears, and my ſpirits ſlow'd too faſt with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48978:9"/>
the Idea's of things to take any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of them; how long I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in that ſtate of inſenſibility, I cannot well tell; but the firſt thing I took notice of, was, that the Scene was ſtrangely altered, and from a heap of Ruines chang'd to a ſtately and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Cathedral; at the Eaſt-end of which was a large Antick Tomb, which by the many Lamps, that in a moment enlightned all the Church, ſeem'd to have been lately plundred, for the Ornaments were thrown about, and they had drop't ſome of the <note place="margin">They had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral falſified Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts, <hi>vid.</hi> His Reformation.</note> bones for haſte; among which, one was of a Horſe of a large ſize: Lord, thought I to my ſelf, was St. <hi>Bucepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> buried here? Indeed I was ſo amazed, that I could not tell whether I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep or awake, in the land of the living, or among the dead; ſo that I began to feel for my ſelf, to know whether I was Fiſh or Fleſh, or good Red-herring, when as my thoughts were diverted with a long <hi>Entrada</hi> of <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks, who went in Proceſſion up to the Shrine, and ſtanding around it with Tapers in

ſufficiently taught what a grievance ye were to our Forefathers: and the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have better Maxims of Eccleſiaſtical Policy, than to ſuffer Lord-Abbots in Parliaments, who with their Tribes are the Pope's ſworn Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to execute his Luſts againſt their Soveraigns by a Vaſſalage, which Cancels all other Oaths and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatever.

Oracles among the Heathens more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous for their Falſhoods and Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before they were ſilenc'd of old; and that the Writings of all Pious, Learned and Witty men, ever ſince the Conqueſt, can teſtifie by undeniable Evidence; who might as well have gone about to puff out the Moon, as Reform you by their Writings, for nothing but diſſolution, or annihilation could doe it: Therefore begon (cry'd he) ye leud ſpirits, wrapt up in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch't Exhalations; ye impiouſly adorn the <hi>Shrine,</hi> whilſt ye traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly invade the <hi>Throne,</hi> and in vain do ye invoke the Name of the <hi>Saint,</hi> whilſt ye rebell againſt the Majeſty of the <hi>King;</hi> but <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey.</hi>

No ſooner was the Goſpel, that great and glorious Reformation of the World, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, but we find it oppoſed by <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> by <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who though differing in Intereſts and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions engag'd in the ſame <hi>Aſſociation</hi> to make <hi>Coeſar</hi> a glorious King, by killing him who gave him his Authority: And although the Goſpel planted in the world by our Saviour and his Apoſtles conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued three Centuries in its Purity, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Perſecutions and Tribulations; yet the damages it receiv'd by Hereſies (which are the tares among the wheat) were of more fatal conſequence, being reckon'd 80 by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward multiplied into ſuch infinite Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Superadditions, taken either from <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Heathen</hi> Cuſtoms, and found beneficial to the ambitious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſinful men; that then Chiriſtian Piety began to decay, and give way to gaudy ſuperſtition; and a policy worſe than deviliſh, becauſe pretended to be heavenly, was ſet on foot, which has made a great part of the world ſlaves, and not a few Atheiſts. Thus truth was

            <p>Never were Church and State more happy, whoſe united Intereſts ſeem'd founded upon a Rock, never to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated or removed: The firſt years of her Reign promiſed a Succeſſion of Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon Ages, and the Kingdom look't like the World new born from the darkſome Womb of the Chaos, calm Glories o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the happy Iſles, whoſe Lands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the Virgin Spring after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and ſucceſſes Crown'd the Seas: The Excellency of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> were given to the Vallies, and the Beauty of <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> to the Mountains; the Wilderneſſes bloſſom'd like a Roſe, and Gleams of Joy warm'd the Northern World.

            <p>Sir, I wiſh it were poſſible (ſaid I) that you could appear openly, for then thoſe many people who are deluded would be convinc'd of theſe things you ſay.

cared much for his Conſcience when it had done getting of money, or prove any thing the honeſter for it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince ſuch ſerious occaſions cannot move them, I think it the beſt way for you to laugh them out of thoſe ſtubborn and fooliſh humours which ſubject the Nation to ſuch real Miſeries, and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Calamities as it lately felt by a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Reformation; if you run into ſuch diſorders again, it will be queſtion'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be Chronicled for the greater Fools, or they for the greater Knaves; to prevent which, there is variety of means, and all lawfull and neceſſary; frowning and laughing are performed by the ſame ſinews, and may have both the ſame ends; and I do not reade any one Canon of Scripture againſt bitter Ingredients in the cure of a deſperate diſeaſe: Go therefore to the Zealous of the Land, and tell them who ſurfeit with Preaching, and are ſick of the Prayers of the Church, who are light-headed with Reformations, and want of ſleep; who would have all the World of their opinions, and yet are not of the ſame mind one hour; who pretend to

love nothing but God and their Wives; that they are deſired either to leave off hatching of Diſciplines and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or multiplying and encreaſing; for they will certainly doe one of theſe things; either they will people the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Ideots, for 'tis remarkable that the very genius of this people is much altered ſince Tobacco and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations grew ſo cheap; and there is ſcarce a Fanatical family of note which has not ſome one or others of it, who have the Cramp very ſignally upon their Intellectuals), or elſe they will beget a Generation that will breed teeth only to bite and devour one another: Or laſtly, a Generation that will either curſe them or laugh at them, who will fill all their Stages with one anothers Grandſires; and to convince them of this, ſhow them only what has been done by ours that were before us, both by true Papiſts and true Proteſtants (as they call themſelves) either under the pretence or notion of a thorow Reformation; you will find, that though they have two faces that look different ways, yet they have both the ſame Lineaments, the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

the ſame Practices, and both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently deny them, like the two men that ſtole the piece of Fleſh from the Butcher, in the Fable: He that took it, ſwore he had it not; he that had it, ſwore he did not take it; who took it, or who has it, I do not know (quoth the Butcher), but by <hi>Jove</hi> ye are a couple of Knaves: this was one of the firſt <hi>Aſſociations,</hi> but now the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> is compleat, becauſe they both make it a <hi>Myſtery;</hi> and untill the time to come diſcover fully the truth of things preſent, pray give the World an Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Account of what has been done by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> firſt, and then by the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians;</hi> and then ye may gueſs for the future why they are ſo like one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who they are that Reform Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſelf, that can ſtab men without ſpilling a drop of Blood, or ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at it when 'tis done without being guilty; that can Rebell without Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Plot without Rebelling; by obſerving what has paſt in the laſt Age, you will know what a great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reformation they are endeavouring now.

            <p>His hand was ſo very cold, and put my head into ſuch a dizzineſs, that I could not tell where I was; for the firſt thing I ſtumbled at was the Threſhold of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> and I fell backward into the year 1534; it was on St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s day, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> was ſeated in his Throne in his <hi>Pontificali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> and all the Cardinals; with Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of Orders, Biſhops, Abbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which made a very ſplendid ſhow; the Anthems then ſung were excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures, and the Muſick extraordinary to carry on the Solemnity of the day, when on a ſudden a great Groan was heard, as if ſome Infernal ſpirit had howl'd in <hi>Diſdiapaſon;</hi> and as well as I could diſtinguiſh it, cryed <hi>Reform.</hi> At this the Eunuchs could not ſing one Note more, but made noiſes like hoarſe Cuckows; the Cardinals Hats began to flag, and the Gems in the Triple Crown were in an Eclipſe; and there was ſo great an

moreover, that Perjury and Simony were two flowers of the Triple-Crown; that Adultery, Inceſt and Sodomy were Sins of Quality, that brought in vaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and Cuſtoms, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Paſſes to the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they ought not to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but upon honourable terms; that if Vice was Baniſht the World, <hi>Purgatory</hi> would be utterly uninhabited, and his Holineſs would never be able to lay an Embargo upon <hi>Charon</hi>'s Boat again.

            <p>The Pope contented to ſtay at home, haſtned the Council with all poſſible ſpeed; and becauſe the people of <hi>Rome</hi> talk't of things either as they firſt heard them, or as they were prejudic'd.

Four Legates, Two Cardinals, Three Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Twenty-five Archbiſhops, Two hundred ſixty eighty Biſhops, Seven Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, Thirty-nine Proctors of Men abſent, Seven Generals of Regular Orders do ſign, and ſubſcribed to the Decrees of the Council (which the Hereticks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject), for which you hear they are in General <hi>Anathematized,</hi> therefore ought you not to fear falling into Hereſie?

               <hi>Palavicini,</hi> the Jeſuit, was afterwards ſo proud, that he makes that biting <hi>Jeſt</hi> a ſerious <hi>Truth</hi> in his Book, which he wrote a long time after to confute your Relation of the Tranſactions of the Council: Mine, (quoth Father <hi>Paul)</hi> I was juſt now going to give this perſon a ſhort account of them; but I owe him ſo much kindneſs, that I will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to reade it at length; but to ſtay his ſtomach for the preſent, I will tell him ſome of the laſt part of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Game, the <hi>Papalins</hi> then play'd.

               <hi>all cry out for Reformation, requires it, and it muſt not be refuſed, in regard of the glorious Name thereof; but by reaſon of thoſe Plots which the</hi> Ultramontan's <hi>have lay'd to abate that abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty which God hath given us, we muſt ſpeedily call the Council.</hi> The firſt thing mentioned was, that none but the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates ſhould propoſe any thing in Council; and becauſe <note place="margin">L. 6. 439.</note> they found difficulty about the Article of <hi>non-reſidency,</hi> the Pope haſtned away all the remaining Biſhops to <hi>Trent;</hi> what Poſtings were there <note place="margin">472.</note> night and day from the <hi>Council</hi> to the <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> untill they had gained this point?

reckoning up the abuſes of Princes <hi>Courts,</hi> and threatning them with ſuch a Reformation, as the meaneſt Subjects would refuſe, becauſe it put their lives into the hands of every <hi>deſperate</hi> Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain.

that will not be obedient to them; you muſt think they were not good which were procured by ſuch ill means; and, if you will not believe me, hear what <hi>Andrew Dudithius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>five Churches,</hi> as learned as any in that Council, ſays to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Emperour, <hi>That</hi>

            <p>We perceive by <hi>Raynolds,</hi> that the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> very well knew this; and therefore whilſt the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were buſie to advance their Diſcipline, they thought them fit tools to carry on their Fifth <hi>Monarchy;</hi> their Principles being both alike deſtructive, both of Church and State; in order to which, they quarrel with our Reformation; and as the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> would have it, Cry up a thorough one of their own: Of which I will give you ſuch a full ſight, if you will go along with me, that you ſhall never forget it untill you are in heaven.

that 'tis to kill the man that is dead; and it had been well for this Nation, if as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> put up their Swords again quietly, they had put themſelves into a poſture of Peace: No, no, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he, <hi>Jack Presbyter</hi> muſt have a holy War too; and ſince he fought for the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he may as lawfully kill Malignants, as the Pope ſlew Infidels to regain his Sepulchre.</p>

thoſe <hi>Interlopers,</hi> who troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about things they neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nor had to doe withall; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would have blamed thoſe men who called themſelves either <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> or that ſtiled themſelves <hi>Arminians;</hi> as he did thoſe, who ſaid, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> I am of <hi>Apollo,</hi> or I am of <hi>Cephas;</hi> for among the many methods thoſe Rebels uſed to obtain their glorious Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was none of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: Firſt of all it made a great diviſion among the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and that numerous part of them, which contrary to their Oaths, ſeparated from the Church either ignorantly or wilfully upon the account of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> became the greateſt Incendiaries of all, and the chief Promoters of that unnatural Rebellion: And ſecondly, the People who by them were taught the Diſcipline of <hi>Calvin,</hi> were taught likewiſe that <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> was down-right <hi>Popery,</hi> which the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ceremonies of the Church branded with the ſame Character confirmed to them, who could know no better; therefore <hi>they</hi> muſt help too to promote the Reformation aforeſaid, <hi>they</hi> muſt

The Gentleman obſerving me to be ſomewhat backward, took me by the Arme; And, pray Sir, (ſaid he) give your ſelf a little trouble, it will be much to your ſatisfaction I will aſſure you: You muſt expect to be a little warm, for <hi>Presbytery</hi> and the <hi>Sweating Sickneſs</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> much about

the ſame time. Warm, Sir, (ſaid I) is that all the danger? Truly I do not like their Looks, what do they come hither for? For what, (ſaid he) to take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt <hi>Popery?</hi> Why, Sir, (ſaid I) is any body to be hanged for it? No, replyed he; but yonder is a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that will doe execution upon it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: Pray, Sir, (ſaid I) what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have theſe People to be afraid of <hi>Popery?</hi> They do not look as if <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> would beſtow the <hi>Alcoran</hi> upon them; for I do not believe that they ever had any Religion, but they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grac'd it: they look more like <hi>Jews</hi> than any other people living, or indeed like an Aſſembly of <hi>Egyptian Mummies.</hi> And truly untill they ſtirred, I imagined that ſeveral of them next the Wall, had been Antic Wainſcot, or <hi>Groteſque</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; but one Fellow amazed me mightily, for he was of ſuch a courſe grain'd Complexion, that I thought an <hi>Effigies</hi> belonging to ſome Tomb had been walking away from its Pedeſtal. Whilſt I was looking around me, there ſtept a living Creature up into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, that took up all my Thoughts; he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48978:50"/>
was in the moſt mortified Dreſs that you can imagine, for the white Border upon his black Cap, made him look like a <hi>Black Jack</hi> tipt with Silver; he wrinckled his Face up and down that it reſembled a <hi>Crab-lanthorn</hi> poſſeſt with a Devil, who had crumpled all the upper Cruſt with his Horns and Hoofs; after he had been a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time putting himſelf into a poſture of Uglineſs, and had wiped the Pearl from his Snout; at laſt his Mouth opened, his Lips trembled, his Eyes twinkled, but nothing was yet heard but a little grumbling in his Guts, as if his Fervency lay in his Chitterlings: the Audience in the mean time ſtretcht their Ears untill they look'd like <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants</hi> Luggs, and then to gratifie them a word or two ſlipt out of his <hi>Trunk;</hi> but at laſt he roar'd ſo loud that I could not imagine but that there was an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low place in his Head to make an <hi>Echo,</hi> and the method and matter of his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er confirmed my fancy; for excepting the malicious part of it (which reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King and his Loyal Subjects, in which his Prayers for them contain'd a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48978:50"/>
ſcandalous Invective againſt them,) thoſe which were for deliverance from their Enemies (as he called them) were ſawcy and blaſphemouſly fooliſh; their uſual ſtrain of <hi>ex tempore</hi> praying; concluding, <hi>That it would pleaſe the Lord to take his and their Foes a knock on the Coſtard,</hi> and then they would joyn their hands to <hi>ſmite them Hip and Thigh:</hi> This way of Praying was the Reformation of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and according to the Rules of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,</hi> a ſuperfine way of propagating Sedition, leaving them ſcope to inſert whatever might move the Paſſions of the ignorant Rabble, and might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Form for devout <hi>Necromancers</hi> to raiſe the Devil. But now for a touch of his preaching, which was the modiſh Eloquence of <hi>Church-Conventicles</hi> in thoſe days: The Subject he treated upon was <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Proteſtant Diſſenters againſt the common Dangers of Popery;</hi> and his Text in order to it was this. <hi>And in the</hi>

               <hi>the Zuſims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaueh Keriathaim.</hi> He was forc'd to ſpit five or ſix times before he entred upon his Diſcourſe, the ſpeaking the Text had made his Mouth water ſo mightily, but after he had done fluxing he began.</p>

               <q>Beloved<hi>!</hi> And ſhall we, and our Brethren in the Country, and our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> be ſmitten by the Kings of the Earth, as the poor <hi>Emims</hi> and <hi>Zuſims</hi> were?

            </p>
            <p>Beloved! If theſe People I here mention be Strangers unto you, take it upon my word they were the ancient <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> and this <hi>Chedorlao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> was a huge great <hi>Popiſh</hi> King, a mighty tall Man, with a dimple upon his Chin, above ſeventeen hand high; a great ſign of being a Perſecutour. Pray obſerve, he came in the fourteenth year, there he cheated the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> becauſe he came in the <hi>Popiſh Stilo vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi> But who do you think came with him? Why all the Kings he could rap
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48978:51"/>
and rend; <hi>Antichriſtian French Kings,</hi> Sons of <hi>Belial.</hi> And what do ye think his Majeſty <hi>Chedorlaomer,</hi> and the Kings that were with him, did? Why, firſt they <hi>came,</hi> and ſecondly they <hi>overcame,</hi> and ſmote the <hi>Rephaims,</hi> yea they ſmote them, even the <hi>Rephaims</hi> of <hi>Aſhteroth-Karnaim.</hi> I ſuppoſe this was a good Town of trading, Beloved, there was a World of theſe honeſt People formerly of the <hi>Ims,</hi> there was the <hi>Rephaims,</hi> the <hi>Zuſims,</hi> the <hi>Emims,</hi> the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and <hi>Seraphims,</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rims,</hi> and <hi>Thummims,</hi> and they all come from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>le <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mmim;</hi> but now there is not one of them to be had for love or Money. And what ſhould be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſo many godly people ſhould be ſmitten? why truly they were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and were united far aſunder. Do ye think that if theſe Proteſtants had made a Bargain to ſtand by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Kings</hi> could ever have ſmitten them? Do ye think that if they had entred into <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> before the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he would not have left all Buſineſs to defend them? Yes verily, the Lord loves to ſee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48978:52"/>
his ſecret ones go hand in hand like a <hi>Yoke of Oxen.</hi> But now, Beloved! Let us conſider the reaſons why we are not united, for the <hi>Zuſims</hi> and the <hi>Emims</hi> Caſe is ours at this day; I ſay, what is the reaſon? why truly, the reaſon is becauſe there is no reaſon at all; for are we not all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> though we go by ſeveral Names? If we had all the ſame Name, how ſhould we know one from another? Then if I called my Wife, my Maid would come, and there would be ſuch coming and going, and going and coming, that we ſhould be like <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> walking to and fro. What! one is called a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> another an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, a third an Anabaptiſt, what ſignifies theſe Names? Are we not all Proteſtants? Shall a few Letters, we learnt when we were Boys, make us quarrel now we are Men? Nay, now we are come of Age to be Martyr'd? And have we not reaſon to fear it? For 'tis certain that the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> is coming with a great many <hi>Kings</hi> after her Tail; and then what do ye think will become of us? She will eat of the beſt, and drink of the beſt; She will
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48978:52"/>
eat up all your <hi>White Bread,</hi> and leave you nothing but <hi>Brown-Bread.</hi> And do you think that is all? No! She will ſend you Slaves to the <hi>Sugar</hi> Mines, or drown you by the way in the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Sea. One would think this enough, but hold ye there; She will kill you over and over again; She will fetch the Heart's Bloud and Gutts of your <hi>Souls</hi> out, and pick your Pockets. Ah! my Beloved, Ah Lord!

            <p>As ſoon as he had ended, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pull'd me by the Sleeve; and what, Sir, (ſaid he) do you think of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Cicero?</hi> What, Sir, (ſaid I) I think they have been dead this half year.

            <p>I went along with him in the Crowd, untill we came into a ſpacious open Field, in the midſt of which was a great Ring of People hand in hand, in the middle of them a <hi>Scotch</hi> Bag-piper, and a Fellow blind-folded, dancing to the Tune of 41. Bleſs me, thought I, what is here to doe? what have we a dance of <hi>Satyrs</hi> in a <hi>Fairy Circle?</hi> As ſoon as we were come cloſe up to them, I never ſaw ſuch different ſhapes of Men in all my Life, there was not one of them like to another. Pray, Sir, (ſaid I) what are theſe?

Oh!

            <p>He could not ſpeak one word more, for there flew ſuch a Volley of Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets that we could ſcarce hear or ſee any thing elſe for them; I gather'd up a good number of them, and found them to be moſt Scandalous, and Seditious Libells, defaming the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State;</hi> done with all the Artifice in the World to inflame the Rabble: and they, whoſe private Affairs were

either inconſiderable, or deſperate, ſeem'd moſt concern'd for the Publick. For the firſt Troop of thoſe Bleſſed <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</hi> were a great number of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,</hi> who, by a Paper, were advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſack <hi>Lambeth-Houſe.</hi> I followed them <note place="margin">May 9. 1640.</note> as near as I could, but they being forc'd to retire without effecting their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe returned back into the City: At my entrance I heard ſuch a diſmal noiſe, as if the Inhabitants had been throwing the Houſes about one anothers Ears; before I was aware of any Danger, I was up to mine in the <hi>Mobile,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along with ſuch a torrent of greaſy <hi>Operators,</hi> that I could not diſengage my ſelf; all the way they went yelling, and howling as if they would ſplit their Mouths up to their Ears; the very Earth trembled, the Teeth of half <hi>Middleſex</hi> were ſet on edge, and the Clouds were ſour'd, and curdled with the din: I thought they would have ſqueez'd my Gutts out at my Mouth with crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and feared every moment when they ſhould give me a gentle Dab with one of their Weapons, for they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48978:56"/>
were all arm'd with Clubs, and Glaves, and old ruſty Halberts, in the midſt of them, one carried an Enſign of <hi>Scotch-Cloth,</hi> with <hi>Juſtice</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Reformation</hi> on the other in great Red Letters: they were led on by a <hi>Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Sweeper,</hi> who carried his <hi>Cromes</hi> in Imitation of the <hi>Roman Faſces,</hi> he went gnawing a Bone, and crying out <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice!

            <p>I perceived that this Magical <hi>Jargon</hi> had conjur'd up a Rabble as formidable as the other, who in <hi>Legions</hi> ran vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently down to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> crying out, <hi>NO Biſhops, no Biſhops!</hi> when the Throng was paſt, I followed <hi>Calamy, Baxter, Newcomen</hi> and <hi>Owen,</hi> and ſome others, untill they were got into a private Place, where they ſoon changed their Countenances, and began to Laugh as heartily as ever the <hi>Wicked</hi> did in their Lives; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus upon the merry pin, <hi>Calamy</hi> invited them all to his Houſe, telling them, <note n="†" place="margin">Calamy<hi>'s Apol.</hi> 1646.</note> That <hi>they knew that his Houſe was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the worſt of Times, that 'twas there the Remonſtrance was fram'd againſt Prelates, that there they had their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>

They went with him, and I followed them, without the leaſt ſuſpicion, for indeed their Actions began now to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the World their private Deſigns, although they coloured them with a world of Hypocriſie to the People. As ſoon as they were entred, they threw off their Cloaks, and taking their Girdles which were ſtuck round with Daggers, Ponyards and <hi>Stilletto</hi>'s, caſt them away with Contempt: <hi>Saying,</hi>
               <q> What need have we any longer of theſe ſneaking Tools? have we not found out a more compendious way of deſtroying the malignant <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Canaanites</hi> that are among us?

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48978:58"/>
ſtay'd no longer, but ſlipt out of doors as faſt as I could. I had not gone a quarter of a Mile, before I fell into ſuch a Drove of <hi>City Dames,</hi> that I thought the <hi>Amazons</hi> had landed at <hi>Billinſgate,</hi> with a Reſolution to eſtabliſh a <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> of <hi>Women,</hi> becauſe the Men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered things no better: They had long <hi>Samples</hi> in their Hands, on which with their Thimbles, Bodkins and Needles, they had wrought, and drawn up a very curious <hi>Petition</hi> againſt <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Lords;</hi> which a grave old Gentleman obſerving, fell a Laughing heartily, and by all the Goddeſſes (quoth he) this is a very beautifull World, is it come to this?

they now for making <hi>Cakes</hi> for the <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and for reducing <hi>Pudding-Pyes</hi> to their Primitive Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? I cannot tell (ſaid I) whether or no they have a true Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, but I fancy the Reaſon why they are ſo incens'd againſt Popery is; becauſe 'tis a great Hinderer of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>Did they know what a great many, like to prove good Husbands, the Wars (ſaid he) will deſtroy, they would not be ſo eager to promote them.

            <p>Whilſt I was muſing upon what he had ſaid, I obſerv'd that the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of many People were chang'd, and ſome ſeem'd to tremble with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, and others were ſtupifyed with a ſolitary Silence, wondring at the ſudden alteration; (for there had been ſeveral <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> for the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Victories the <hi>Rebels</hi> in the Courſe of the Wars had gained.) At laſt a Rumour ran, that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was in the Hands of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but one confidently affirm'd that his Life was threatned by a <hi>High Court of Juſtice.</hi>

            <p>At this a Reverend Clergy-man that had been plundred, and ſequeſtred, and had nothing left to beſtow upon

his unfortunate Sovereign but Prayers, and Tears, ſhed them plentifully, and turning towards us: Is this (ſaid he) the way to make the Prince Glorious, and the People happy? Is this the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of <hi>Antichriſtian Rome,</hi> and can it not be done without Bloud more Royal, than that with which the Walls of <hi>Heathen Rome</hi> were firſt cemented? Is it not enough that by their Canting and Railing, they have ſtirred up all Orders of People into an unnatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, but they muſt now crown all their Villanies with cutting off the Head of the King?</p>
            <p>Pray Sir, (ſaid I) to him, who are thoſe you ſpeak of? Come along with me (ſaid he) and I will ſhew you whom I mean preſently.</p>
            <p>I followed him as far as <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and he carried me into a large place which was ſomewhat dark, and hung around with Mourning; I obſerved a conſiderable number of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>Divines,</hi> there ſitting with Armes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Eyes lift up, looking ſo pale and ghaſtly, as if from a Body of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they had dwindled into the very

It was in vain for them to open their Mouths, for they had nothing either to Anſwer or Eat; ſo there being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Silence for ſome time, I at laſt turned to the honeſt Clergy-man (I before mentioned) and deſired him if he could doe me that Favour, to give me a ſhort view of the ſeveral Pranks the <hi>Saints A-la-mode</hi> had played up and down the Kingdom. Nothing (ſaid he) can pleaſure me more than to ſatisfie you with a Deſcription of their <hi>thorough Reformation,</hi> which I ſhall ſoon do if you follow me: As we were walking together, you muſt conſider (ſaid he) that all the Villanies that are acted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Notion are the Effects of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Zeal, and however they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain mightily in the <hi>Gangraena,</hi> 'twas they firſt putrified the Nation; 'twas they firſt taught the Rabble to <hi>Reform,</hi> and then they learnt of themſelves to <hi>Blaſpheme.

            </p>
            <p>No, (ſaid he) do you think he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not?

            <p>I could not hear what he ſaid more, for the Echoes of chopping, hacking and defacing whatever came in their way, which was either decent or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent; but obſerving a Fellow at the Poor-mans-Box, with a Back-Sword, lifted up over the <hi>Effigies</hi> of a Cripple ſtanding upon it, I was reſolved, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to hear what he had to ſay to it;

when I was got cloſe to him, Thou lame Idol, (quoth he) that halteſt betwixt two Opinions, that haſt Feet and walkeſt not, I will hew thee in pieces, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did <hi>Agag</hi> before the Lord in <hi>Gilgal!</hi> At a few Strokes he cut it down, and had ſo ſplit the Box that out flew ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pieces of Braſs and Silver, which he greedily catching; thou art (ſaid he) like the Image in <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fables, which did the Man no good whilſt he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd it, but now being broken thou ſheddeſt thy <hi>Mammon</hi> like <hi>Bloud:</hi> I left him, to obſerve a Tribe of <hi>Quakers</hi> who were got to the <hi>Steeple,</hi> and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo mighty Zealous againſt it, that they would have pulled it down about their Ears, had they not feared it might have beaten off their Hats, but nothing more offended them than the <hi>Bells,</hi> and their great Fault was that they called others to Church although they never came in themſelves; ſo that whatever was ſaid to prove them true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Bells, that they had never been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as <hi>Popiſh</hi>

            <p>THE Horrour of paſt Villainies, and the endleſs proſpect of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Calamities, had ſo benumb'd my
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48978:78"/>
Spirits with drowſie Grief, that I fell into a profound Trance for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, untill at length I was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the loud and joyfull Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of vaſt Multitudes, crying, <hi>God ſave King Charles the Second:</hi> At this I look'd and ſaw a mighty Train of People, ſo ſplendid and brave, as that the very confuſed Light of infinite Jewels made them reſemble a new <hi>Milkie-Way,</hi> in which <hi>Charles</hi> his <hi>Triumphant Wain</hi> was then moving. Surely, (ſaid I) although I have not taken ſo long a Nap as the <hi>ſeven Sleepers,</hi> yet I have ſnored out more ſtrange Revolutions; what gloomy Days were thoſe I firſt began to nod in? What Confuſions in Church and State? what cruel Animoſities? what fatal Diviſions? and what was worſt of all, Popery big with a whole Ages Revenge, like a <hi>Polyphemus</hi> ready to devour all; but now my waking Senſes are ſaluted with the harmonious Triumphs of univerſal Joy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Very ſtrange indeed, replyed my old Guide, (who carefully attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me) and you might ſtill think your ſelf in a Dream, were not our preſent
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48978:78"/>
Happineſs as real as were our former Miſeries. I hope, Sir, (ſaid I) they will be as laſting. I wiſh ſo too, (ſaid he) but do not you ſee what ſoure Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces yonder grim Fellows make? thoſe cloudy Looks ſtill threaten many a Storm to this <hi>Nation:</hi> At this I ſaw a great number who ſeem'd ſomewhat diſcontented, and were earneſtly whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering and talking to one another, and as ſoon as I came up to them, I found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſeveral <hi>Presbyterians, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Anabaptiſts, Quakers</hi> and ſome <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who let fall ſome myſtical words which diſcovered a great deal of ſecret diſſatisfaction, but for what I could not tell; for the briskeſt <hi>Cavaliers</hi> in the Kingdom did not ſeem more active, in ſolemnizing his <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than moſt of them did. So that turning to my Friend, certainly Sir, (ſaid I) thoſe People are not Breeding of <hi>Common-Wealths</hi> again, ſo ſoon after their Delivery; I hope they have no democratical Qualms in their Stomachs, and have done longing for <hi>thorough Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations</hi> for one while. I confeſs, (ſaid he) one would think what you
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48978:79"/>
ſay; and beſides at the Solemnities of the King's Coronation, they hung out as conſpicuous Evidences of their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, as any the moſt Obdurate <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> for their Garlands were richly loaden with the glittering Confeſſions of their former Plunder and Sacrilege, but their <hi>Loyalty</hi> was exactly like the Weather at that time, very fair for a little Seaſon, and very foul both before and after; they know how to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize with preſent Difficulties in hopes of future Advantages, and can be as <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> Loyal, as they were <hi>boldly</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, think they may talk what Treaſon they pleaſe if they do but wipe their Mouths after it; and act what Villainy they will if they do but waſh their Hands when they have done; a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſort of Varniſh, left for a Legacy by <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and which came by the way of <hi>France,</hi> in company with the <hi>Holy League,</hi> to the <hi>Covenanters</hi> of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> for when <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> was prevailed upon by the Solicitations of others, and his own natural Clemency, to give them leave to enjoy their former Privileges in that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48978:79"/>
Kingdom, from which they were baniſh'd with Infamy, for the treacherous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Predeceſſour, they had ſuch a ſtrong fit of Obedience, that they at laſt became abſolute Maſters of his Heart.</p>
            <p>Sir, (ſaid I) if I may not interrupt you too long, I will wedge in a ſmall <hi>Caveat,</hi> which ſhall be <hi>A-la-mode,</hi> and not at all unſeaſonable at this Juncture of time; <hi>Boccalin</hi> in his third Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement concerning the Civil Warrs of <hi>France,</hi> and the Murther of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, brings in <hi>Apollo, commanding</hi> that 60000 Pack-horſes ſhould be ſent from <hi>Arcadia</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and when it was anſwered that there was no danger ſince they had ſo noble and numerous a Cavalry, He replyed, <hi>That ſince the peace and quiet of that Kingdom depended upon their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, they could not come to it by any better means than by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their former Miſeries; as thoſe Pack-Horſes, which by Inſtinct of Nature did deteſt paſſing a ſecond time by the ſame way, wherein formerly they had run the Hazard of breaking their Necks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:48978:80"/>
I wiſh (ſaid he) that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would take Example of the <hi>French,</hi> who being not half ſo wiſe as the <hi>Pack-Horſes,</hi> are become a Pack of <hi>Aſſes,</hi> ſo that their King is not improperly ſtyled <hi>Rex Aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>norum,</hi> for he has laid Burthens upon their Shoulders almoſt as bad as breaking their Necks<hi>:</hi> But our dull ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Aſſes, who fancy themſelves fit Cronies to bray with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> are ſo far from taking warning by the Harms of others, that they have forgot their own; and whilſt the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> privately prick them forward, their Teachers have theſe twenty Years been leading them by the Ears into another Rebellion<hi>:</hi> therefore, if you will go along with me, I will give you as pleaſing an account of all their Actions ever ſince the King came in, to this day, as your Heart can wiſh; I will lay before your Eyes, at one view, all the Stratagems and Deſigns both of <hi>Jeſuited Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> by which we may gueſs what a Superlative <hi>Reformation</hi> we might expect for the Future, if they had their Wills for the Preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48978:80"/>
With all my Heart, Sir, (ſaid I) as ſoon as you pleaſe, nothing can oblige me more: ſo away we went; as we paſſed along, You muſt know (ſaid he) that the <hi>King</hi> was ſcarce ſetled on his Throne, and the Brethren hardly recovered of that dreadfull Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſudden Change had put them into, (juſtly fearing to be made Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for all the bloudy Villanies they had perpetrated in that Rebellion;) but in contempt of his unparallel'd Mercy, and of his Juſtice too, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play the old Game over again, and to run on Tick upon a new Score. The Murtherers of the King, his Father of Bleſſed Memory, were repreſented to the People as the Righteous Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a glorious Cauſe, and their laſt Speeches recommended as the groaning Oracles of dying Martyrs, but if thoſe be their <hi>Saints,</hi> what are their <hi>Devils?</hi> Surely never ſuch Villains were cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd before, ſince the World began.</p>
            <p>Yes, Sir, (replyed I) their Fellow-Labourer, <hi>James Clement,</hi> is as much extoll'd by <hi>Mariana</hi> the Jeſuit, for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi>

            </p>
            <p>Come on, (ſaid he) you ſhall receive a great deal of ſatisfaction, but no harm. I know no reaſon why I ſhould not be as valourous as a Gliſter-Pipe, although I thought it an odd kind of Portico to the <hi>Sthadt-Houſe</hi> of Darkneſs, and ſo in we went: he carried me through a great
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48978:81"/>
many narrow windings and turnings, that I fancy'd my ſelf wilder'd in ſmall Gutts, untill at laſt I came to a pair of Gates all cruſted and embroidered with Salt-Peter; as ſoon as they opened we entred a ſpacious and large Hall, at the upper end of which ſtood that Greekiſh Gentleman old Mr <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, alias <hi>Time,</hi> with a Scythe in his Hand, and a true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Hour-glaſs of a large ſize on his Head<hi>:</hi> This is (ſaid my Friend) the <hi>Chronicle Room,</hi> wherein are laid up all the <hi>Archiva</hi> of Fanaticiſm, this is the <hi>Regiſter Office</hi> of the <hi>Democraticks,</hi> a Place which they are unwilling that any but thoſe of their own Faction ſhould ſee. I think, Sir, (ſaid I) that we were forc'd to creep in at the wrong end of the <hi>Body Politick,</hi> before we could come at it<hi>:</hi> 'tis no matter for that (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he) now you are here, pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe 22 large Tables all along the Walls, which are engraven with red Letters, what are they? (ſaid I) Why! they are the 22 Years laſt paſt, with the Contents of all their Deſigns and Villanies upon them, and over them you ſee the Hiſtorical part of them
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48978:82"/>
painted in large Figures to the Life, we will not examine them all, becauſe ſome of them contain the ſame things over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but what you think the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, I will expound to you<hi>:</hi> Sir, (ſaid I) I think they did little in 1661, onely I obſerve ſome of them grumbling over a good thick <hi>Quarto-Book.</hi> That is (ſaid he) their Liturgy of 76 <hi>Quarto</hi> Pages, for the Excellency of which they <hi>appeal to the People,</hi> becauſe the King and Biſhops would not admit of it. But here is to doe, and to doe, in the Year 62: yonder is ſome of them going to Execution upon Hurdles; thoſe are <hi>Tong, Gibbs, Phillips</hi> and <hi>Stubbs,</hi> who then ſuffered for High-Treaſon, (replyed he) and perhaps they were engaged in the bloudieſt and moſt barbarous Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy that ever was hatch'd, in which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Presbyterians</hi> joyn'd with them, as is evident from the Particulars of their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; the <hi>End</hi> of it was to deſtroy the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> the chief Miniſters of State, all the Biſhops, moſt of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of the Gentry, and Commonalty, all that ſhould any way oppoſe them, or had formerly diſguſted them; and all
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48978:82"/>
to <hi>reform</hi> the Kingdom to a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> again<hi>:</hi> This was ſo far from being a <hi>Sham-Plot,</hi> that in order to it they had their Council of Six, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of Secrecy, their General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Agents, Treaſurers and Magazines, held Correſpondence in moſt Counties; deſign'd to ſecure the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Windſor,</hi> the <hi>Towre</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> had appointed the very time to begin their Villany in, which was to have been on <hi>All-Hallows Eve,</hi> a proper time for our modern <hi>Saints</hi> to commence <hi>Deviliſm</hi> in; and all under the Notion of a <hi>Popiſh Maſſacre.</hi> Now let us obſerve what were the more publick humours of thoſe Days. Why<hi>!</hi> the ſeveral Factions began their ſeparate Congregations, made a formal Schiſm, united their broken Intereſts; and by all Arts imaginable, endeavour'd to lay the Foundations of another War; they preach'd nothing but Perſecution<hi>!</hi> Perſecution! and ſet the dolefull Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs of their ſilenc'd Miniſters before their Farewell Sermons. Libels flew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in Swarms, and <note n="*" place="margin">

Example of <hi>Ehud,</hi> who ſtab'd the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> was juſt upon the Wing, but was ſtopt in the Preſs; many other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, if I had time, I might relate, but theſe are enough to ſhew you that the <hi>Saints</hi> were no Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
            <p>They began (ſaid I) to play their Pranks ſo early, that I believe they will never make an end; never (ſaid he) untill there is an end made of them: for in the Name of them all, old <hi>Arthur Jackson,</hi> in a Letter of his, dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. 1662, and at a time, when he ſaid he was come to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, muſt die, tells his Friend that the 2<hi>d</hi> Reaſon why he too did not conform, was; <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>The doing of any thing contrary to the covenanted Reformation, which they had ſo earneſtly prayed for,</hi> or that might be ſcandalous to thoſe that rejoyced in the firſt Fruits of it, <hi>and do ſtill deſire and endeavour to promote it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, Sir, (ſaid I) enough of old <hi>Arthur,</hi> and the Year 62: But I wonder to ſee them ſo buſy in the Years 65, and 66. which were dreadfull enough, with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48978:83"/>
the immediate Judgment of God upon the Nation, and the City of <hi>London</hi> particularly; but inſtead of appeaſing the Wrath of God, they ſeem active to ſtir up the Fury and Indignation of Men againſt one another, by encreaſing the aſtoniſhment of the People with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Prophecies, and terrible and romantick Stories, by hinting that their Governours were the Cauſes of their Calamities; thus making the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> a Motive to <hi>Wars,</hi> with a Zeal more raging than the Flames that conſumed the City, and more contageous than the <hi>Plague</hi> that deſtroyed the Inhabitants; ſo that when we reflect upon the virulency of their Principles, and the deſtructive Practices they have produced, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> was more than a Poet, when he ſaid,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Come Peſtilence and reap us down,</l>
               <l>Come God's Sword rather than our own.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But Sir, (ſaid he) look upon the Year 1673, is not that a pleaſant Change? It looks, Sir, (ſaid I) like a Year of <hi>Jubilee.</hi> I never ſaw ſo many
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48978:84"/>
People of different Humours ſo well pleaſed, what is that that makes them ſo devoutly Brisk and Jolly? They had then gain'd a <hi>Toleration,</hi> (replyed he) by the means of my Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> whom you ſee leading a <hi>Phalanx</hi> of Romaniſts on one ſide, and the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> at the Head of a Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Herd on the other. <hi>Toleration</hi> (ſaid I) is a thing of very ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ever ſince the <hi>Horſes</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> broke looſe, and ran away with Eſquire <hi>Phaeton;</hi> and ſo made the firſt <hi>Leap-year,</hi> from which time we date all the unhappy Diviſions among Judicial <hi>Aſtrologers.</hi> But did the Papiſts help to procure a Toleration? No wonder then we ſo often hear of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in the Conventicles of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and that they both of them have ever ſince more induſtriouſly conſpired the deſtruction of the Government.</p>
            <p>Now you ſpeak (ſaid he) of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> look upon theſe two Tables that contain the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot.</hi>

I cannot well reade them, (ſaid I) I think 'tis wrote in Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s Characters, and ſo ſullied that although there is a certain account of a <hi>Plot,</hi> yet I cannot underſtand many particulars; ſurely they who firſt contrived it, found out this way in caſe of diſcovery to ſham it. But what do you think (ſaid he) of him that diſcovered it? I cannot tell (ſaid I); <q>well then, (replyed he) I will tell you a Story: There was a certain good natured Man who lived within a Mile of an <hi>Oak,</hi> and he was one Day ſitting in his Houſe, when there came a little wandring Fellow to him, and told him that in ſuch a place there lay a hideous and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Wolf,</hi> with a deſign to devour both him, and his whole Flock of Sheep; he being carefull to preſerve his Flock as well as himſelf, prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrives to apprehend and ſecure the <hi>Wolf;</hi> as he was going he had like to have fallen into an <hi>Ambuſcado</hi> of <hi>Bears,</hi> which were the Relations and Friends of <hi>him</hi> that diſcovered the <hi>Wolf,</hi> and altogether as ravenous; upon this he carefully retires to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48978:85"/>
what was beſt to be done: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it was, there was a terrible <hi>Wolf,</hi> of the very race of the <hi>Wolf</hi> that was wet Nurſe to <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus;</hi> but the <hi>Bears</hi> lay in the way, who were as dangerous, for they would beat down all the <hi>Bee-Hives</hi> (the Emblems of <hi>Monarchy)</hi> for the ſake of the Honey; and beſides, they alarm'd the <hi>Wolf,</hi> ſo that <hi>he ſculk'd away for the preſent:</hi> at laſt one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him thus. Sir, you have a <hi>Lion</hi> and a <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> in your Houſe, the beſt in the World, and without more adoe, ſet them briskly on both the <hi>Wolf</hi> and the <hi>Bears,</hi> and if they come any more I will be bound for their good Behaviour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I underſtand the Moral of it, Sir, (ſaid I;) but that Picture for the Year 1680, does quite poſe me, the Painter deſerves to be rewarded as the Poet <hi>Choerilus</hi> was, for the few good Lines in it: Whilſt (ſaid he) you ſtand right againſt the Central Line you can make nothing of it, but come this way, what do you ſee now? The <hi>Pope</hi> (ſaid I.) Go that way, what do you ſee now?
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48978:85"/>
               <hi>Jack Presbyter.</hi> Juſt ſo, (ſaid he) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule of Painting have they intermix'd the Popiſh and Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Plots, that if a Man be not rightly fix'd they confound one another, if he be he ſees them both in their proper Colours. But as they have had traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſigns upon the Government for above 100 Years laſt paſt, ſo ſince the Toleration they have been more than ordinarily active in their Conſpiracies, which their more open and publick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours do ſufficiently prove, and if you will not believe me, pray obſerve them.</p>
            <p>At this a pair of great Gates open'd, and diſcovered a ſpacious Court full of all ſorts of People, like the <hi>Exchange-Walks;</hi> at our firſt entrance, a Fellow with a whole Basket of Pamphlets had like to run over me, crying, <hi>Mirma, Maromah, Maroum,</hi> or a Prophecy of the downfall of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Do not you wonder, (ſaid my Friend) to hear theſe People threatning the Pope with a whole Volley of <hi>Rumbling Gibberiſh,</hi> who were but lately ready to run out of their Wits for fear of him, when
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48978:86"/>
the Pamphlet entituled the <hi>Growth of Popery</hi> was printed. Oh! Sir, (ſaid I) I ſuppoſe this is onely to whet the <hi>Iraſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Appetite of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to knock at <hi>Rome</hi> Gates, as they threatned in the Days of <hi>Oliver.</hi> This is (replyed he) fitted for an <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> to deſtroy the Government under the Notion of <hi>Popery,</hi> and would be as ſerviceable to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ends in <hi>France.</hi> But on the other hand, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are a ſort of Fellows playing upon the <hi>Hypocondria's</hi> of the Rabble, and telling them ſad Stories of a Prophecy found in a Kettle, of a ſtrange <hi>Monk-Fiſh,</hi> taken in the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Sea, upon the Coaſts of <hi>Northampton-ſhire:</hi> yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are others ſelling your true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Almanacks,</hi> wherein all the <hi>twelve Houſes</hi> are made <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and many other ridiculous, nonſenſical and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Papers are thrown about, with which the fickle Rout firſt kindle their Zeal, and then light their Pipes, but theſe are their Tricks of old. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us try if we can hear what yonder Perſon (whom I know to be a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in Diſguiſe,) is ſaying to the

            <p>I ſmiled to think what a biting Jeſt ſome merry <hi>Tory</hi> had put upon them; but more ſurprized was I to find my ſelf accoſted by the very ſame <hi>Jeſuit</hi> that had been talking with the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians;</hi> for, (laying his Hands upon my Shoulders with a great deal of Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity;) now you ſee (ſaid he) who

We grant you that you are in no caſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to <hi>act againſt your Light:</hi> No, by no means ſo to act, as to make that <hi>light darkneſs,</hi> which you do, if you be wilfully ignorant, and blind; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, you ſay <hi>'tis clear that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate has a Power to Command:</hi> Many thanks to you for <hi>that,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Property</hi> of his that may be <hi>felt;</hi> and that's more: But how is it not ſo clear, that he has a Power <hi>to determine things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different?</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:48978:119"/>
why, the following Clauſe makes it <hi>obſcure: And make theſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations the conditions of my enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means of ſalvation.</hi> Pray how, or in what ſenſe do you mean his <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them the Conditions,</hi> &amp;c. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you had a Tryal for a Title to an Eſtate, becauſe the Supreme Magiſtrate appoints the time, place and perſons for the <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> would thoſe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations be the conditions of your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not the <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> conditions certainly, but the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> you can make, and the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Law. Now if you will rather chuſe to be <hi>non-ſuited,</hi> than comply with ſuch <hi>determinations</hi> which may be to your advantage, much good may it doe you. Moreover, it is generally believed, by all natural Philoſophers, that a man may walk into a Church, though it ſtands Eaſt and Weſt, if all the doors be open; though ſome <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondrical</hi> people would fancy they could not, and that the door is either too little for their Noſes, or their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes too big for the Door. Now, Sir,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48978:120"/>
you will ſay, that Conſcience, though erroneous, is not melancholy, and that the caſes we talk of are not <hi>Civil,</hi> but <hi>Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> therefore ſay you 'tis certain, that Conſcience, though falſe, obliges; but that 'tis uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Commands do, or no.

               <p>If the Commands of a Father, or Maſter of a Family, do not in ſuch Circumſtantials, for many reaſons I have given; how then can ſuch Commands of a Supreme Magiſtrate, whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions may be ſo large, that they cannot punctually be obſerved? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a ſtrict Law were made at <hi>Paris,</hi> that every particular Church in the Nation ſhould commence their publick Service on the Lord's day, preciſely at nine a clock, it is Mathematically cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that ſome would have done, and got half through <hi>their dinners,</hi> before others would be half way in <hi>their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions;</hi> they in the fartheſt Eaſtern Parts would have come to their <hi>Amen,</hi>

               <p>They would be pretty well out of the hearing and interrupting one another, that's the comfort of it: If the <hi>Man</hi> in the <hi>Almanack,</hi> though pelted with all the Signs of the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack,</hi> had not brought a better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I would ſentence him to be ſtuck in the Pillory, that his Noddle might be influenc'd with rotten Eggs; and therefore keep your <hi>Mathematical</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for your <hi>Sunday</hi> Pudding.
